- show in which direction there is markers/jump to marked blocks
- more vi navigation, jump to line number
- jump to next and previous global symbol
- propper linebreaks in help

source:
- display source
- change focus between source and assembler
- navigate in source/close source view/open source view
- jump between lines in both views
- mark corresponding lines, and show lines in other view
- enable navigation through marked regions (showing in statusbar the directions?)

later:

- syntax highlightning in source view
- jump to labels with completion in assembler
